- 👋 Hi, I’m @sprezzatura
- 👀 I’m interested in learning web design and creating a portfolio that will help me land a job in the industry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, and one or two of the most popular libraries.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment but I hope to gain some open source experience down the line.
- 📫 You can reach me via e-mail: dualism04@gmail.com, or DM me on Twitter @dualism04.
